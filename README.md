# Fearless Monolith to Microservices Migration – A guided journey

This repository is a clone from [ticket-monster-msa/monolith](https://github.com/ticket-monster-msa/monolith) maintained by Christian Posta, who gave us kind permission to reuse it for our cloud migration showcase.

The repository is a monorepo of projects that illustrate migrating a monolith application (TicketMonster) to microservices on OpenShift. For this journey, a blog post series explains the required concepts and best practices. Find background information and instrucitons how to use this repo in our [Fearless Monolith to Microservices Migration – A guided journey](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/fearless-monolith-to-microservices-migration-a-guided-journey/) blog series that guides you through the different stages in a structured manner. 

## Overview

This repository consists of a couple of sub-projects used to illustrate a migration from a JAVE EE monolithic application ([Ticketmonster](https://github.com/ticket-monster-msa/monolith)) to microservices living in the OpenShift platform.

### Dynatrace OneAgent Operator
Apply the Dynatrace OneAgent operator on your cluster to have full insights and monitoring enabled for your complete OpenShift environment. Find more information in the blog post here: https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/introducing-dynatrace-oneagent-operator/ 


### monolith
The getting started experience begins with the [monolith](./monolith/README.md) project. In this project we deploy our monolith application and understand the domain, architecture, and structure of the application that will be the foundation for successive iterations.
 
### monolith-proxy
A simple proxy webserver that is in front of the monolithic TicketMonster and can serve for different purposes. In our example, it simply redirects traffic to and from the TicketMonster.

### tm-ui-*
<!-- 
The `tm-ui-*` folders contain different versions of the front-facing UI that we use as we migrate from a monolith to split out the UI to the set of microservices.
-->
The [tm-ui-v1](./tm-ui-v1/README.md) folder contains a version of the front-facing UI that we use as we migrate from a monolith to split out the UI to the set of microservices.

<!-- 
### backend

The `backend-*` folders contain the monolith with the UI removed and successive iterations of evolution. With `backend-v1`, we have taken the monolith as it is and removed the UI. It contains a REST API that can be called from the UI. In `backend-v2` we've stated adding feature flags for controlling the introduction of a new microservice. See each respective sub project for more information.
